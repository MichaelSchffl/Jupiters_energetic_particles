# Jupiters_energetic_particles

 -- This is a short summary and explanation file for this project -- 

## Introduction
In this project we want to know more about energetic particles in Jupiter's vast magnetosphere. Specifically, we want to learn about their energy distribution with respect to the magnetic equator. We also want to learn about the angle they form with the local magnetic field, called the pitch angle (PA). In order to achieve this, we use data from the JEDI instrument of the Juno spacecraft (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-013-0025-3). This instrument detects high energetic ions in its orbit around Jupiter. Every 53 days it performs one full orbit. The data for this project were obtained from the JMIDL software of the JHUAPL and can be downloaded from this repository.
Ultimately, our goal is to speculate about a heating mechainsm that accelerates ions in Jupiter's middle magnetosphere by looking at the obtained distribution functions.

###Task

 - The datasets provide particle intensities as a function of the energy (keV) and as a function of the pitch angle along with the time the measurements were taken. As a first step, these intensities shall be allocated to the times we know the spacecraft is ... 
 
 
 
 ### How to run the code
The main script is commented so that it should be clear what is the purpose of each programming step. This is a quick walkthrough how to run the code and how to interprete the results it is providing:
- download the 'Orbitxx'-folder you are interested in
- run the code in your Jupyter Notebook. A cell can be run with ctrl-enter or shift-enter (jump to next cell)
- insert the path in the interactive boxes and follow the instructions
